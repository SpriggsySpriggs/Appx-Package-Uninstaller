# Appx-Package-Uninstaller
This program displays the list of currently installed Appx packages and uses a PowerShell script to uninstall the selected app. Useful for uninstalling bloatware apps that can't be uninstalled by the usual uninstall method.

This program comes with no warranty, express or implied. For support, post in the Issues section or email me at zspriggs14@gmail.com
